# Heart-disease-prediction
Visualization and prediction of heart disease using an interactive dashboard
# Project Overview
The leading cause of death in the developed world is heart disease. Therefore, there needs
to be work done to help prevent the risks of having a heart attack or stroke. This project aims
to create an interactive Dashboard using IBM Cognos Tool and dataset to predict which
patients are most likely to suffer from a heart disease in the near future using the features
given.
# Purpose
Heart disease (HD) is a major cause of mortality in modern society. Medical diagnosis
is an extremely important but complicated task that should be performed accurately
and efficiently. Cardiovascular disease is difficult to detect due to several risk factors,
including high blood pressure, cholesterol, and an abnormal pulse rate. Based on the
analytics we can analyze which patients are most likely to suffer from heart disease in the
near future and based on the patient details we will make decisions to cure them.
